The compile commands for most of the source code will be simply:

csc <filename.cs>

In some situations, the SRS code for instance, the compile commands
will be somewhat more complicated. There will either be a text file
CompileCommand.txt or in-line comments in the code that will tell 
you how to compile those examples.
